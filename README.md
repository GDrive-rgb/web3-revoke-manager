**EVM Approval Manager** provides a clean, scriptable interface and a simple GUI to inspect and revoke token allowances (`ERC20`, `ERC721`, `ERC1155`) granted to smart contracts. It's designed for security researchers, developers, and power users who need direct, low-level control over their wallet's security profile.

## Key Features

- **‚õìÔ∏è Multi-Chain Native:** Scans Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, and other EVM networks.
- **‚ö° High-Performance Scanning:** Utilizes efficient RPC calls to quickly identify all active approvals.
- **üîí Direct Revocation:** Generates and signs transactions locally to revoke approvals without relying on third-party services.
- **üñ•Ô∏è Simple GUI:** A straightforward graphical interface for ease of use.
- **üì¶ Minimal Dependencies:** Built with a focus on performance and security, avoiding heavy packages.

Ensure you have Python 3.9+ and Git installed.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GDrive-rgb/web3-revoke-manager.git
    cd web3-revoke-manager
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment:**
    The application requires RPC and Explorer API keys. Copy the example file and populate it with your credentials.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Then, edit the `.env` file with your keys.

## Usage

To launch the graphical user interface, run the main application file from the project root:

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will start, allowing you to input a seed phrase to begin scanning for approvals.
